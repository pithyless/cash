# Cash

Money object for your application. Based on BigDecimal and ISO-4217 currencies.


## Features

Encapsulates an amount with its currency.

Backed by BigDecimal, so it can store arbitrary-precision values without rounding errors. Useful if youâ€™re dealing with fractional cents.

Safe and strict. Fail fast approach let's you sleep like a baby.


## Compatibility

Tested on Ruby 1.9, 1.8, JRuby, and RBX:
